      <h2>The history of the PlayStation brand</h2>
      <p>
        On December 3, 1994, the PlayStation story officially began for gamers. On that occasion, Sony launched
        the first version of the console – the PSone – in Japan. The big difference was the graphics superior 
        to the previous consoles and the transition from cartridges to CDs. From there, then, Sony started a 
        dynasty that brought a series of changes and innovations to the world of games. With five official 
        numbered versions (in addition to two handhelds and a series of extras), the PlayStation is one of the
        main entertainment products on the market and is still a highlight today. In all, there are more than
        550 million copies sold between the different versions of the console, in more than two decades of 
        history. In fact, it’s not uncommon to hear PlayStation being used as a generic term for consoles in general.
        <br/>
        In the early 1990s, the market was taking its first steps towards the 3D era, and the PlayStation 1 helped
        pave the way for popularizing the technology, as it ran games on CD-ROM and enabled notable improvements 
        in graphics and sound design. .
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sony obviously wasn’t the first company to launch a console, with the likes of Atari, Nintendo, and Sega coming before it. 
        But it certainly made gaming cool again, bringing the medium to new audiences.
        The PlayStation 5 is still very recent in the gaming industry, but it has been gaining more and more space.
      </p>
      <h3>Origin and Nintendo</h3>
      <p>
        In the beginning, the history of PlayStation began in a joint initiative between Sony and Nintendo. 
        Despite being market rivals today, the two already had a partnership in the world of games 
        (with the production of the SPIC-700 sound chip for the SNES) and wanted to take it to a new level.
        In this way, the companies developed the concept of the Nintendo Play Station, a console similar to
        the SNES, but capable of reading CDs. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The concept got off the ground and some units were produced 
        for shipping to game developers in 1991, but there were changes in plans. Soon after the first 
        demonstration of the console, Nintendo decided to end the partnership and enter into a new contract
        with Phillips. So Sony was dropped and decided to start their own project.

      <h2>PS2: The best-selling console in history</h2>
      <h4>The PlayStation 2 has been in production for an incredible 13 years, with production having only stopped in 2013.</h4>
      <p>
        Released in 2000, Sony embraced the multimedia experience by offering support for DVDs. This was a big deal because the PS2 
        actually became one of the cheaper DVD players on the market at the time. There was more to the PS2 than DVDs though, as the
        console also played host to some impressive internals. The so-called Emotion Engine CPU and Graphics Synthesizer GPU required
        plenty of finesse on the parts of developers as they were powerful but tricky to program. It wasn’t the most powerful console 
        of the era though, as the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube often enjoyed better-looking graphics. But studios that put in 
        the time and effort were able to deliver gorgeous games like Gran Turismo 4, Metal Gear Solid 2, Shadow of the Colossus, and the
        God of War titles. In fact, we got our first taste of HD games during this era, albeit at 1080i like Gran Turismo 4 and Tourist 
        Trophy.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Another major feather in the PS2’s cap was backward compatibility with PS1 games, which meant you didn’t have to abandon your
        entire collection of older PlayStation games. As for the controller, Sony opted to essentially keep the PS1’s DualShock design. 
        However, the company also made the face buttons pressure-sensitive, so pressing “X” harder would result in faster acceleration in 
        racing games, for example.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There were almost 4 thousand games released for the playstation 2.
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
        It is clear that the extra features of the console gave an extra pull in sales, but the not boosted in seeable prominence that the
        PS2 has highlighted over the expansion of the years, hallmark mark over the years, mark standing out over the years, mark stand out
        from the big franchises in the market. Resident Evil 4, Shinji Mikami's game that revolutionized the Resident Evil franchise, God of War, Guitar Hero, GTA: Vice City and
        San Andreas, Need For Speed ​​Underground and Kingdom Hearts are just some of the games that come to mind.
